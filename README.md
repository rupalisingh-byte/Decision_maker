ðŸŽ² Instant Decision Maker (Flask Microservice)

This is a simple, beginner-friendly web application built with Flask and Jinja2 that helps users make quick decisions by randomly selecting an option from a list of user-provided choices.

It's an excellent project for anyone learning the fundamentals of the Flask web framework, focusing on form handling, template rendering, and state management.

ðŸŒŸ Features

Add Choices: Easily submit new options (e.g., "Go to the movies," "Read a book," "Go hiking").

Instant Decision: Click the "Pick One Now!" button to get a random, unbiased result from the current list.

Clear State: Clear all choices to start a new decision list.

Simple State Management: Uses a global Python list to maintain choices across requests (perfect for a small, single-user learning app).

Modern Styling: Utilizes Tailwind CSS (via CDN) for a clean, fully responsive user interface.

ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the application up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites

You need Python 3.x and Flask installed.

# Install the Flask framework
pip install Flask


Installation

Clone this repository (or save the form1.py file and the templates/form.html file):

git clone 
cd decision-maker-app


Ensure you have the following file structure:

**decision-maker-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ form1.py  # The Flask application logic
â””â”€â”€ templates/
    â””â”€â”€ form.html      # The HTML template (Jinja2)**


Running the Application

Execute the Python file from your terminal:

python decision_maker.py


The application will start, and you can access it in your web browser, typically at:

ðŸ‘‰ **http://127.0.0.1:5000/**

ðŸ”§ Project Structure

**File/Directory

Description

form1.py**

Contains the core Flask application. Defines routes (/, /add_choice, /decide), handles form submissions, and manages the global list of choices (CHOICES).

templates/

The standard directory where Flask looks for HTML templates.

templates/form.html

The main Jinja2 template for the application. It includes the forms for adding choices, displaying the current list, and showing the final decision.

ðŸ’¡ How It Works (Flask Fundamentals)

This project demonstrates these core Flask concepts:

Rendering Templates: The index() function uses render_template('form.html', ...) to send variables (choices and last_decision) from the Python backend to the Jinja2 template.

Handling POST Requests: The add_choice() and decide() functions use the methods=['POST'] attribute to accept data from the HTML forms.

Accessing Form Data: The request.form.get('choice') method safely extracts the data submitted by the user.

The PRG Pattern: After every action (add or decide), the app uses redirect(url_for('index')) to force a page reload, preventing form resubmissions and cleanly updating the display.
